> **Abstract: **

> Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a proactive tool developed to identify, evaluate and prevent product and/or process failures. The conventional FMEA procedure suffers from inadequate definitions for some steps, high uncertainty, and even decision making failures throughout the procedure. The effectiveness of an FMEA can be significantly improved by identifying potential pitfalls, and raising awareness of potential problems. Applying a strategy that utilizes controls and rules can efficiently mitigate, or even avoid, all known possible harmful effects. This article proposes proven solutions that support the entire end-to-end FMEA sequence of activities (from the point of initiation of the analysis - Failure Modes identification - up to its culmination - evaluation of the effectiveness of the procedure), and the remedies proposed, in reducing risk.

_A STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEW OF FMEA/FMECA_ (20-04-2024)
_World Scientific, 05-10-1994_
> **Abstract: **

> The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) documents single failures of a system, by identifying the failure modes, and the causes and effects of each potential failure mode on system service and defining appropriate detection procedures and corrective actions. When extended by Criticality Analysis procedure (CA) for failure modes classification, it is known as Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The present paper presents a literature review of FME(C)A, covering the following aspects: description and review of the basic principles of FME(C)A, types, enhancement of the method, automation and available computer codes, combination with other techniques and specific applications. We conclude with a discussion of various issues raised as a result of the review.
