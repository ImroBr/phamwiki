# Process Hazard Analysis WIKI
This Wiki documents Process Hazard Analyses, aiming to inform and support possible technical inspectors or inquisitive laymen. This project is a work in progress, and is subject to constant updates.

## Introduction to Process Hazard Analysis
A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a method of technical risk assessment. can be defined as:<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>
* A systematic effort designed to identify and analyze hazards and assess the impact in case of a potential failure; and
* A method to provide info;rmation which will help workers and employers in making decisions that will improve safety. 

The PHA method is primarily applied to industrial processes, namely in the chemical process industry. Examples of these processes include purification, dilution, mixing or blending and packaging operations.

## Process Hazard Analysis definitions
Following are terms and definitions used within the PHA scope.<sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>

| Term | Definition |
| - | - |
| Process | A batch or continuous manufacturing step or unit operation involving storage, handling, transfer or processing to convert raw materilas into finished products. |
| Hazard | A process (or material) with a potential to cause damage to people, property or environment. This may happen due to interaction by itself, or other materials in the system, plant or  process. |
| Hazard Analysis | Identification of undesired events that may lead to a hazard, analysis of underlying causes of this hazard, and coupled with an estimation of hazard likeliness and magnitude of harmful effects. |
| Incident | Unplanned event or series of of events and circumstances that may result in an undersirable consequence (e.g., fatality, injury, enviromental and/ or property damage). |
| Process Safety Event (PSE) | An unplanned or uncontrolled loss of containment or build-up of material or energy from a process that resulted in or had the potential to result in an undesirable consequence. |
| Loss of containment | Release or escape of material, usually a gas or liquid intended to be contained within plant equipment or pipelines, to the environment. Loss of containment can vary from small releases (e.g., minor emissions or leaks) to very large releases (e.g., vessel or pipeline rupture). |
| Process safety management (PSM) | Application of management systems and controls (e.g., programmes, procedures, audits, evaluations) to a manufacturing or chemical process so that process hazards are controlled and process-related injuries and incidents are prevented. |
| Personnel safe | The prevention of injury or harm to personnel from incidents that are not process-related. |
| Risk | A measure of human injury, environmental change, reputation or economic loss in terms of the incident likelihood and extent of the loss or injury. |
| Risk Management | The identification, assessment and prioritisation of WSH risks followed by the application of control measures to minimise the probability and/ or impact of undesirable WSH consequences. Assessments are typically reviewed at set intervals (e.g., at least once every 3 years), or when there are changes in a work process or activity, and upon any accident, a near miss or dangerous occurrence. |
| Layers of protection | A design approach that applies multiple safety layers on a hazard to prevent an initiating event (e.g., loss of cooling water) from developing into a process safety event or to mitigate the consequences of one when it happens. |
| Inherently safer design | A design approach that advocates the removal or reduction of a hazard at source, typically during the process design stage. This could be done by eliminating or reducing the hazardous material from the inventory or substituting a hazardous process for a less hazardous one. By eliminating process risks during the design stage, the need for additional layers of protection can be eliminated or minimised. |
| As low a reasonaly practicable (ALARP) | A tolerable level of risk that cannot be reduced without further expenditure on costs disproportionate to the benefit gained or where the solution becomes impractical to implement. |



### PHA distinction


### PHA distinctions and scope
Although the PHA methodology mostly applies to physical industrial processes, the other specific [Hazard Analyses](#available-hazard-analysis-wiki's-in-this-project:) are described in a global manner. Meaning, additional factors that go beyond industrial processes can be taken into consideration. These additional factors can be in a human context such as personnel safety, customer satisfaction or company reputation, or more abstract context such as computational scenarios or software interaction (which can also include emerging or future technology such a AI or quantum computing).  

As such, these other methodologies are considered parallel or even complimentary in relation to PHA, rather than a subset of PHA. Rather, these other methodologies and indeed the PHA method are considered a subset of _Hazard Analyses_.
