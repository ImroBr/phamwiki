# Process Hazard Analysis WIKI
This Wiki documents Process Hazard Analyses, aiming to inform and support possible technical inspectors or inquisitive laymen. This project is a work in progress, and is subject to constant updates.

## Introduction to Process Hazard Analysis
A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a method of technical risk assessment. can be defined as:<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>
* A systematic effort designed to identify and analyze hazards and assess the impact in case of a potential failure; and
* A method to provide info;rmation which will help workers and employers in making decisions that will improve safety. 

The PHA method is primarily applied to industrial processes, namely in the chemical process industry. Examples of these processes include purification, dilution, mixing or blending and packaging operations.

Although the PHA methodology mostly applies to physical industrial processes, the other specific Hazard Analyses are described in a global manner. Meaning, these other methodologies are considered parallel or even complimentary in relation to PHA, rather than a subset of PHA. Rather, these other methodologies and indeed the PHA method are consideren subsets of _Hazard Analyses_.
