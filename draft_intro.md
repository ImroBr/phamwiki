# Process Hazard Analysis WIKI
This Wiki documents Process Hazard Analyses, aiming to inform and support possible technical inspectors or inquisitive laymen. This project is a work in progress, and is subject to constant updates.

## Introduction to Process Hazard Analysis
A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a method of technical risk assessment. can be defined as:<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>
* A systematic effort designed to identify and analyze hazards and assess the impact in case of a potential failure; and
* A method to provide info;rmation which will help workers and employers in making decisions that will improve safety. 

The PHA method is primarily applied to industrial processes, namely in the chemical process industry. Examples of these processes include purification, dilution, mixing or blending and packaging operations.

## Process Hazard Analysis definitions
Following are terms and definitions used within the PHA scope.<sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>

| - | - |
| Term | Definition |
| - | - |
| Process | A batch or continuous manufacturing step or unit operation involving storage, handling, transfer or precossing to covert raw materilas in finished products. |
| Hazard | A process (or material) with a potential to cause damage to people, property or environment. This may happen due to interaction by itself, or other materials in the system, plant or  process. |
| Hazard Analysis | Identification of undesired events that may lead to a hazard, analysis of underlying causes of this hazard, and coupled with an estimation of hazard likeliness and magnitude of harmful effects. |
| Incident | - |
| Process Safety Event (PSE) | - |
| Loss of containment | - |
| Process safety management (PSM) | - |
| Personnel safe | - |
| Risk | - |
| Risk Management | - |
| Layers of protection | - |
| Inheretly safer design | - |
| As low a reasonaly practicable (ALARP) | - |

### PHA distinction


### PHA distinctions and scope
Although the PHA methodology mostly applies to physical industrial processes, the other specific [Hazard Analyses](#available-hazard-analysis-wiki's-in-this-project:) are described in a global manner. Meaning, additional factors that go beyond industrial processes can be taken into consideration. These additional factors can be in a human context such as personnel safety, customer satisfaction or company reputation, or more abstract context such as computational scenarios or software interaction (which can also include emerging or future technology such a AI or quantum computing).  \ 
As such, these other methodologies are considered parallel or even complimentary in relation to PHA, rather than a subset of PHA. Rather, these other methodologies and indeed the PHA method are considered a subset of _Hazard Analyses_.
