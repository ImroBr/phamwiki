# Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

## Introduction 
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a deductive top-down failure analysis tool. Starting at the root cause of a potential failure, a breakdown of composite parts is established to identify, analyze and mitigate undesired state of a system. This is usually done visually resembling a flowchart, utilizing branches and specific logical gateways into what is called a _fault tree_. Analysis of the fault tree can be used for:
* Providing clarity and logical foundation directly starting from a failure or otherwise underised state
* Diagnosing and mitigating the caus(es) of a top event.
* A tool in the design phase of a system. 
* 

## History
Fault tree Analysis was originally developed in 1962 Bell laboratories by H. Watson and A Mears, to evaluate the _Minuteman I Intercontinental Ballistic Missile_ for the U.S. Air Force. Since then, fault trees have gained in popularity as a failure analysis tool.
