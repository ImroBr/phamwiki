# System-Theoretic Process Analysis
_This is an early document which serves as a blueprint for adding specific Hazard Analysys Methodologies._


## Introduction 
_Abbreviation and full name._
System-Theoretic Process Analysis (SPTA) is fairly recent hazard analysis technique. This technique is generally used in larger, complex systems.\
Based on _System Theory_...

## Sybtypes
_Specific variations of main hazard analysis method._


## History
_First inception and cause of hazard analysis method. (Year, person/ group, (geographic) location) Abbreviation_ 
In use after World War II.

## Underlying systems
_Possible underlying system or system predecessor of current hazard analysis_
System Theory - \
STAMP - System-Theoretic Accident and Processes


## Application
Used for: (List)\
Most use cases in current day. Type(s) of application domains.

## Method steps
 
Specific formulas, symbols and/or terminology.


## Logical chronological steps
### 1. Scope
* What type of loss categories are at play (human life, reputation, privacy, security, etc)
* What is the system and its boundary?
* 

### 2. Control Structure
* Capturing functional relationships and interactions




## Example(s)
* Theoretical example
* Example of historical factual application
