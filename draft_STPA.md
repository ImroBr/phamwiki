# System-Theoretic Process Analysis
_This is an early document which serves as a blueprint for adding specific Hazard Analysys Methodologies._


## Introduction 
_Abbreviation and full name._
System-Theoretic Process Analysis (SPTA) is fairly recent hazard analysis technique. This technique is generally used in larger, complex systems. What delineates the STPA method from other conventional hazard analysis methods is the assumption that unsafe interactions between system components could occur, while none of those system may have failed. \
Based on _System Theory_...

## Subtypes
_Specific variations of main hazard analysis method._


## History
_First inception and cause of hazard analysis method. (Year, person/ group, (geographic) location) Abbreviation_ \
STPA is a analysis technique developed by [Nance Leveson](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/bio-serious.html) and [John P. Thomas](http://web.mit.edu/jthomas4/www/index.htm). It is based on System Theory.

## Underlying systems
_Possible underlying system or system predecessor of current hazard analysis_ \

## Application
Used for: (List)\
Most use cases in current day. Type(s) of application domains.

## Method steps
Specific formulas, symbols and/or terminology.


## Logical chronological steps
### 1. Scope
* What type of loss categories are at play (human life, reputation, privacy, security, etc)
* What is the system and its boundary?
* 

### 2. Control Structure
* Capturing functional relationships and interactions




## Example(s)
_Theoretical example_ 



* _Example of historical factual application_


## Pros and cons
Advantages of STPA over other hazard analysis: [p4]
* Very complex systems can be analyzed
* STPA can be utilized early in concept Analysis
* STPA includes software and human operators in analysis to ensure all potential causal factors in Losses
* STPA provides documentation of system functionality, which may be missing in other hazard analyses in the context of large and complex systems
* Easy integration into the system engineering process and model-based system engineering

Disadvantages of STPA:
* Lesser known analysis technique; few online resources

Hazards: System state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss. \
Losses: One or more undesired, safety-critical undesired outcomes to stakeholder(s). It may include a loss of human life or human injury, property damage, environmental pollution, loss of mission, loss of reputation, loss or leak of sensitive information, or any other unacceptable loss. [p16] \
System: Set of components that function together as a whole to achieve a desired goal. A system can contain subsystems, or itself be a subsystem. \
