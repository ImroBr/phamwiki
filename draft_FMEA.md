# Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)

## Introduction 
[[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - asq.org](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea)] \
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a hazard analysis technique, used for identifying all possible failures in a manufacturing/ assembly process, product or service. Best implemented early in the design phase, the goal of FMEA if to eliminate or mitigate failures. Through the FMEA process, failures are identified and numerically categorized from the most undesired outcome.

## History
_First inception and cause of hazard analysis method. (Year, person/ group, (geographic) location)_ \
Procedures for FMEA were first described November 9th 1949 by the U.S. Department of Defense (MIL-P-1629) [x] as FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis). Primarily utilized in the military industry, it was later adopted by the space industry (NASA). In the 1970 in was introduced to the automotive industry (Ford).
