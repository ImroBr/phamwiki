# Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)

## Introduction 
[[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) - asq.org](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea)] \
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a hazard analysis technique, used for identifying all possible failures in a manufacturing/ assembly process, product or service. Best implemented early in the design phase, the goal of FMEA if to eliminate or mitigate failures. Through the FMEA process, failures are identified and numerically prioritized starting from the least desired outcome.

## History
_First inception and cause of hazard analysis method. (Year, person/ group, (geographic) location)_ \
Procedures for FMEA were first described November 9th 1949 by the U.S. Department of Defense (MIL-P-1629) [x] as FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis). Primarily utilized in the military industry, it was later adopted by the space industry (NASA). In the 1970 in was introduced to the automotive industry (Ford).

## Variations
_Specific variations or successions of main hazard analysis method._ \
### FMECA (*Failure Modes, effects and criticality analysis*)
Similar to the FMEA process, this variant encorporates Criticality as an additional parameter. A Critical characteristic associated with a failure mode is a measurements or indicators that reflect safety or compliance with government regulations and need special controls. Critical characteristics have a high severity rating because of this. \
FMECA is sometimes used interchangably with FMEA. \

## Additions/ Notes

## Used terminology
Glossary containing as many relevant and specific terms

| Term | Definition |
| - | - |
| Action Priority (AP) | A new gradient from the AIAG/ VDA handbook<sup>[2]</sup>, replacing the classical FMEA RPN and risk matrix. The AP aims to encompass additional improvement measures. |
| Criticality | - |
| Detection | Signified as "D", detection denotes the degree a process controls can detect either the failure mode or its cause before the client is affected. Usually noted on a 1-10 scale, in which 10 can be likened to a problem being certainly undetectable (or no process control present) and 1 is a certainty of detecting a problem. |
| End Effect | Consequence a failure mode has upon operation, function or status at the highest indenture level |
| Failure | Any error, defects or abnormalities that negatively impact system functionality, especially affecting the customer. |
| Failure Effect | The immediate consequence of a failure during operation.  |
| Failure Mode | - |
| Indenture levels | Levels which indentify or describe (relative) complexity of a function or assembly. |
| Local Effect | The consequence a failure mode has on the current specific operation, function or status under analysis. |
| Next higher level effect | Consequence a failure mode has on operation, function or status at the next higher indenture level above the currently analyzed item. |
| Occurrence | Signified as "O", occurrence denotes a (probabilistic) chance of a failure occurring. Usually noted on a 1-10 scale, in which 10 can be likened to inevitability and 1 to (extreme) unlikeliness. |
| Probalility | - |
| Process Control | Preventative or mitigating procedures, mechanisms or tests that attempt to prevent or curtail a failure before the client is affected. |
| Risk Priority Number (RPN) | The  |
| Severity | Signified as "S", severity denoted the degree of negative impact of a potential failure. Usually noted on a 1-10 scale, in which 10 can be likened to catastrophe and 1 to insignificant. |
