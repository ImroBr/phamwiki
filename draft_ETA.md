# Event Tree Analysis (ETA)

## Introduction 
Event tree analysis (ETA) is a forward, top-down, logical modeling technique for both success and failure that explores responses through a single initiating event and lays a path for assessing probabilities of the outcomes and overall system analysis.<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup> This analysis technique is used to analyze the effects of functioning or failed systems given that an event has occurred. <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>
