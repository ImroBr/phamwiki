# Event Tree Analysis (ETA)

## Introduction 
Event tree analysis (ETA) is a forward (bottum-up), logical modeling technique for both success and failure that explores responses through a single initiating event and lays a path for assessing probabilities of the outcomes and overall system analysis.<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup> This inductive analysis technique is used to analyze the effects of functioning or failed systems given that an event has occurred. <sup>[[2]](#references)</sup> \
This technique explores system responses to an initiating _challenge_ and enables assessment ofthe probability of an unfavorable or favorable outcome. The system challenge may be a failure or fault, an undesirable event, or a normal system operating command.<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>

## History
The concept of what eventually came to be named _Event Tree_ was conceived by the UKAEA (United Kingdom Atomic Energy Agency) in 1968, as risk assesment tool to optimize the design of a 500MW Steam-Generating Heavy Water Reactor. Use of ETA resulted into a manageable form. <sup>[[1]](#references)</sup> 
The term "Event Tree" was first introduced during the WASH-1400 nuclear power plant safety study circa 1974.

## Underlying systems
Possible underlying system or system predecessor of current hazard analysis

## Variations
Specific variations or successions of main hazard analysis method.

## Application
ETA is mostly used in:
* Nuclear power plants
* Spacecrafts
* Chemical plants

## Method steps
The followin steps are necessary to successfully employ the Event Tree Analysis.

1. Define the system: Define what needs to be involved or where to draw the boundaries.

2. Identify the accident scenarios: Perform a system assessment to find hazards or accident scenarios within the system design.

3. Identify the initiating events: Use a hazard analysis to define initiating events.

4. Identify intermediate events: Identify countermeasures associated with the specific scenario.

5. Build the event tree diagram

6. Obtain event failure probabilities: If the failure probability can not be obtained use fault tree analysis to calculate it.

7. Identify the outcome risk: Calculate the overall probability of the event paths and determine the risk.

8. Evaluate the outcome risk: Evaluate the risk of each path and determine its acceptability.

9. Recommend corrective action: If the outcome risk of a path is not acceptable develop design changes that change the risk.

10. Document the ETA: Document the entire process on the event tree diagrams and update for new information as needed.
