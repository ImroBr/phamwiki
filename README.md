# Process Hazard Analysis Wiki (phamwiki)
In an evolving automotive industry, there must exist an equal or greater evolving need for safety. Many `Process Hazard Analyses (PHA)` exist to mitigate risks, but may risk falling behind in a world where processes increase in complexity, creating unforeseen risks.
As such, a need arises for a robust foundation and contrast of PHA methodologies. This project aims to add to this foundation in the form of online documentation for future use.

## WIKI environment
This GitHub WIKI-environment contains documentation about Hazard Analysis (HA) methodologies. A _Hazard Analysis_ entails identification of undesired events that may lead to a hazard, analysis of underlying causes of this hazard, and coupled with an estimation of hazard likeliness and magnitude of harmful effects.

Scope of the project is [**ISO 26262**](https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html).

### Intended audience
This Wiki documents Process Hazard Analyses, aiming to inform and support possible technical (automotive/ RDW) inspectors or inquisitive laymen. Information is provided from an entry level, and may be supplemented with more advanced theory as the project matures.

### PHA distinctions and scope
Although the PHA methodology mostly applies to physical industrial processes, the other [Hazard Analyses](#prerequisite-hazard-methodologies) are described in a global manner. Meaning, additional factors that go beyond industrial processes can be taken into consideration. These additional factors can be in a human context such as personnel safety, customer satisfaction or company reputation, or more abstract context such as computational scenarios or software interaction (which can also include emerging or future technology such a AI or quantum computing).

As such, these other methodologies in this WIKI are considered parallel or complimentary in relation to PHA, rather than an instance or subset of PHA. Rather, these other methodologies and indeed the PHA method are considered a subset of _Hazard Analyses_.

## Wiki page prerequisites
Each particular wiki-page at will at least contain the following subjects/ headings:
* Method name
* Method description
* Method steps
* Pro’s and con’s
* Example(s)
* Related literature/ studies

## Prerequisite hazard methodologies
Following are the available HA pages on this WIKI:
* [Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)](/draft_PHA.md)
* [System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)](/draft_STPA.md)
* [Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)](/draft_FMEA.md)
* [Failure Tree Analysis (FTA)](/draft_FTA.md)
* [Event Tree Analysis (ETA)](/draft_ETA.md)

## Future additions
This WIKI may be supplemented with additional documents and features going forward, depending on available time and functional-utilitary demand. Some of these feature are already known and may be included in the next project update:

### Future Hazard Analyses methodologies
* Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) (stand-alone description)
* Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)
* Bowtie-analysis
* Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)
* [Kepner-Tregoe method](https://kepner-tregoe.com/faqs/)

### Features to be added
* Further theoretical expansion of method descriptions and literature
* Better visual support along with method steps
* (More advanced) examples
* More examples in the context of automobiles
* (Advanced) cross-comparisons between Hazard Analysis methods
