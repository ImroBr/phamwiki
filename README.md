# Process Hazard Analysis Meta-Analysis (phamwiki)
In an evolving automotive industry, there must exist an equal or greater evolving need for safety. Many `Process Hazard Analyses (PHA)` exist to mitigate risks, but may risk falling behind in a world where processes increase in complexity, creating unforeseen risks.
As such, a need arises for a robust foundation and contrast of PHA methodologies. This project aims to add to this foundation in the form of online documentation for future use.

## Assignment goal
Create a Wiki-environment in where risk mitigation methodologies (Process Hazard Analyses) are described. Each methodology must contain a general descriptive overview, while also delineating the differences between each methodology. Description of methodological steps of each approach and supplementation of examples and references are also prerequisites.


Scope of the project is [**ISO 26262**](https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html).

## Wiki page prerequisites
Each particular wiki-page must contain the following headings:
*	Method name
*	Method description
*	Method steps
*	Pro’s and con’s
*	Example
*	Related literature/ studies

## Prerequisite hazard methodologies
* [ ]	FMEA
* [ ]	STPA
* [ ]	FTA
* [ ]	HAZOP/ ETA (ETA preferred)

(Informal) deadline is *June 21<sup>st</sup>*.

If the above described minimum foundation is achieved before the deadline, the following additions will be committed:
•	Addition of PHA methodologies
•	Further deepening of methodologies
