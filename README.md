# Process Hazard Analyses (phamwiki)

## 
In an evolving automotive industry, there must exist an equal or greater evolving need for safety. Many `Process Hazard Analyses (PHA)` exist to mitigate risks, but may risk falling behind in a world where processes increase in complexity, creating unforeseen risks.
As such, a need arises for a robust foundation and contrast of PHA methodologies. This project aims to add to this foundation in the form of online documentation for future use.

## WIKI content
This GitHub WIKI-environment contains documentation about Hazard Analysis (HA) methodologies. A _Hazard Analysis_ entails identification of undesired events that may lead to a hazard, analysis of underlying causes of this hazard, and coupled with an estimation of hazard likeliness and magnitude of harmful effects.

Scope of the project is [**ISO 26262**](https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html).

## Wiki page prerequisites
Each particular wiki-page at will at least contain the following subjects/ headings:
*	Method name
*	Method description
*	Method steps
*	Pro’s and con’s
*	Example
*	Related literature/ studies

## Prerequisite hazard methodologies
Following are the available HA pages on this WIKI:
* [Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)](/draft_PHA.md)
* [System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)](/draft_STPA.md)
* [Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)](/draft_FMEA.md)
* [Failure Tree Analysis (FTA)](/draft_FTA.md)
* [Event Tree Analysis (ETA)](/draft_ETA.md)

## Future additions
This WIKI may be supplemented with additional documents and features going forward, depending on available time and functional-utilitary demand. Some of these feature additions are already known and may be included in the next project update:

### Future Hazard Analyses methodologies
* Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) (stand-alone description)
* Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)
* Bowtie-analysis
* Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)


### 

(Informal) deadline is *June 21<sup>st</sup>*.


If the above described minimum foundation is achieved before the deadline, the following additions will be committed:
•	Addition of PHA methodologies
•	Further deepening of methodologies
